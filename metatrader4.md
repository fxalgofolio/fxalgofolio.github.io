Based on the C-like language structure of MQL4, the framework is implemented for MetaTrader 4 as a library of boilerplate code included in the expert advisor code.

There are three "modes" implemented in this library:

* **Normal mode**: uses implemented system in normal trading execution.
* **Test mode**: uses system entries and exits in various selected tests.
* **Walk-forward mode**: uses the system within a restricted time range.
