The framework is based on the book <em>Building Algorithmic Trading Systems: A Trader's Journey From Data Mining to Monte Carlo Simulation to Live Trading</em> by Kevin Davey:

Learning to trade
-----------------

<em>Note: Use the following as a guide to start learning. Useful knowledge is most definitely not limited to these lists.</em>

First, if you have absolutely no idea about reasons for changing prices apart from pretty charts and cliches like "it's magic" or "buy low, sell high", start with understanding basic economics:

* <a target="_blank" href="http://www.investopedia.com/university/economics/economics3.asp">Economics Basics: Supply and Demand - Investopedia</a>
* <a target="_blank" href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/02/101502.asp">What Is Market Efficiency? - Investopedia</a>

It is critical to understand the markets you trade. For the foreign exchange market, the following are good places to start:

* <a target="_blank" href="http://www.babypips.com/school">School of Pipsology - BabyPips.com</a>

Next, since algorithmic trading is highly technical and quantitative, learn as much as you can about trading strategies and technical analysis to get a feel for the mathematical principles behind some of the technical indicators so you can be sufficiently informed to glean the mechanics at work in a trading strategy.

* <a target="_blank" href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/11/four-types-of-active-traders.asp">4 Common Active Trading Strategies - Investopedia</a>
* <a target="_blank" href="https://ta.mql4.com/indicators">Technical Indicators - MQL4</a>
* <a target="_blank" href="http://www.investopedia.com/active-trading/technical-indicators/">Technical Indicators - Investopedia</a>

Since this project is about algorithmic trading, know everything about how other people do it:

* <a target="_blank" href="https://www.quantstart.com/articles/How-to-Identify-Algorithmic-Trading-Strategies">How to Identify Algorithmic Trading Strategies - QuantStart</a>
* <a target="_blank" href="https://book.mql4.com/">MQL4 Book</a> (if using MetaTrader 4)
* <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118460146/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1118460146&linkCode=as2&tag=zhangtaihaome-20&linkId=48af9126dca778cc0c12007e70e4507d">Algorithmic Trading: Winning Strategies and Their Rationale</a> by Ernie Chan

Finally, if you have access to a public or university library, you can sometimes find interesting books on trading systems to broaden your horizons.
